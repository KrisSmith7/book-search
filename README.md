# book-search

## Objective
This purpose of this project is to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

Starter code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli).
